import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

:::danger[Important]
Lilybird does not officially support `deno`, while the core will probably work there is no guarantee that the modules or for that matter some of the example commands will
:::

## Installation

The fastest way to get started with lilybird is by using our template generator.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash frame="none"
    npm create @lilybird
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
    ```bash frame="none"
    bun create @lilybird
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash frame="none"
    pnpm create @lilybird
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash frame="none"
    yarn create @lilybird
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Running your first bot

After running the command you should see a file structure somewhat like this:

:::note
The following structure is what is generated when you use Typescript, the javascript template doesnt include the `globals.d.ts` and `tsconfig.json` files.
:::

```
your-bot
├── globals.d.ts
├── tsconfig.json
├── package.json
├── .env
└── src
    └── index.ts
```

### Adding your token

To add your bot token open your `.env` file and add the token after `TOKEN=`.

### Starting your bot

:::tip
If you are using bun you can run `bun start` no matter what language you are using.
:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Typescript">
    ```bash frame="none"
    npm run dev
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Javascript">
    ```bash frame="none"
    npm run start
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Ready for production with Typescript

If you are using typescript we highly recommend adding `NODE_ENV="production` to your `.env` file and if you are using node do the following.

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
