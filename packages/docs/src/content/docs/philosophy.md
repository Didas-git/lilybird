description: A quick rundown on how it works.

Lilybird is a community driven library that focuses on providing the tools you need to interact with the discord gateway and api, every abstraction on top of something that already exists and is simple should not be built into the core.

The core api has been designed so lilybird can stay lightweight and provide different abstractions and new features via modules and plugins.

If there is something you don't like about the library or if you find that something is missing feel free to open an issue on [our github](https://github.com/Didas-git/lilybird). 

:::tip[We welcome ideas!]
We highly encourage sharing different solutions and ideas to achieve the same goals. Do not stick with just what we provide and feel free to expand on top of our core!
