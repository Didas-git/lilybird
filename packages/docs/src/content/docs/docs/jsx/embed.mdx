## Creating embeds

Embeds can easily be created using the main `Embed` component, for properties of the embed you can use the `Embed<x>` versions of said properties.

```tsx
<Embed title="Hello from Lilybird TSX" color={0xff00ef} timestamp>
    {Array.from({ length: 4 }, (_, i) => (
        <EmbedField name={`Field ${i}`} value="bun" inline />
    ))}
    <EmbedFooter text="Hello from bun" />
</Embed>
```
