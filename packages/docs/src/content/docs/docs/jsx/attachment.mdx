import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Creating attachments

The `Attachment` component is really simple to use, it just gets either a file or a path and returns a `LilybirdAttachment`.

:::caution
Passing in `path` instead of `file` will make it so lilybird will try to use `Bun` apis, so if you are using `node` pass in a `Blob` or extension of blob instead.
:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="bun">
    ```tsx
    import { Attachment } from "@lilybird/jsx";
    import { join } from "node:path"

    const att = <Attachment
      path={join(import.meta.dir, "./lilybird.png")}
      name="lilybird"
    />;
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="node">
    ```tsx
    import { Attachment } from "@lilybird/jsx";
    import { readFile } from "node:fs";
    import { join } from "node:path"

    const att = <Attachment 
      file={new Blob([await readFile(join(import.meta.dir, "./lilybird.png"))])}
      name="lilybird"
    />;
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Using attachments

When using the the `Attachment` component you can easily pass in `<Attachment>.uri` to embeds and other places that use the uri form of attachments.

An example would be:

```tsx ins="att.uri"
import { Attachment, Embed, EmbedImage } from "@lilybird/jsx";
import { join } from "node:path"

const att = <Attachment
  path={join(import.meta.dir, "./lilybird.png")}
  name="lilybird"
/>;

const embed = (
  <Embed title="Lilybird" description="For bun, with bun">
    <EmbedImage url={att.uri} />
  </Embed>
);
```
