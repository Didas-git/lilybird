In this guide you will learn how to create a simple ticket bot using lilybird **without** any modules.

## Setup

To setup your bot follow the instructions in the [getting started page](../getting-started/), this will be the foundation throughout this guide.

:::tip
It is highly recommended that you use discord's web version to test your bot, the discord app (both mobile and desktop) cache commands and when you edit/add commands you are pretty much required to restart the apps to see the changes, using the web version you can simply hit `F5` to see your changes.

## Handling your first interaction

Interactions are hte most fundamental building blocks in modern discord bots as they allow us to use buttons, modals and other features.

Lets start by creating our first command, we will call it `ping`.

```ts title="index.ts" showLineNumbers {"1. Make the function async":7-8} ins={9-13} collapse={4-6}
import { createClient, Intents } from "lilybird";

await createClient({
  token: process.env.TOKEN,
  intents: Intents.GUILDS,
  listeners: {

    setup: async (client, payload) => {
      await client.rest.bulkOverwriteGlobalApplicationCommand(client.user.id, [
        {
          name: "ping"
        }
      ]);

      console.log(`Logged in as ${payload.user.username}`);
    }
  }
});

```

Lets create a simple listener that will listen for an interaction called `ping` and reply with some message.

```ts title="index.ts" showLineNumbers del={1} ins={2-5} collapse={11-22} ins={"1. Define the listener":23-24} ins={"2. Narrow down the interaction type so only interactions in guilds will be handled": 25-26} ins={"3. Only chat input interactions should be handled in this case":27-31} ins={"4. Handle the ping command":32-43}
import { createClient, Intents } from "lilybird";
import {
  InteractionCallbackType,
  ApplicationCommandType,
  InteractionType,
  createClient,
  Intents
} from "lilybird";

await createClient({
  token: process.env.TOKEN,
  intents: Intents.GUILDS,
  listeners: {
    setup: async (client, payload) => {
      await client.rest.bulkOverwriteGlobalApplicationCommand(client.user.id, [
        {
          name: "ping"
        }
      ]);

      console.log(`Logged in as ${payload.user.username}`);
    }

    interactionCreate: async (client, payload) => {

      if (!("guild_id" in payload)) return;

      if (
        payload.type === InteractionType.APPLICATION_COMMAND
        && payload.data.type === ApplicationCommandType.CHAT_INPUT
      ) {

        if (payload.data.name === "ping") {
          await client.rest.createInteractionResponse(payload.id, payload.token, {
            type: InteractionCallbackType.CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE,
            data: {
              content: "Pong!"
            }
          });
          return;
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```
