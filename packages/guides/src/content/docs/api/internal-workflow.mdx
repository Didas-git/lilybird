As of lilybird 0.9 the compilation step has been made completely optional and the bellow diagram will suffer some small changes in the future.

### Important steps

The most important step in this entire diagram is the listeners compilation. This is the main reason lilybird can provide such an open API without any performance loss while also allowing us to just discard any unwanted/unused events.

We go into more detail about what exactly the compiler does in the next section.
